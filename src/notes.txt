components:
- components are the files or modules which consiste=s of javascript releated logics which canbe reused.
1.class based components(CBC)
2.Functional based components(FBC)

1.class based components(CBC):
- similar to javascript es6 class.
- CBC components are statefull coponents.
syntax:
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
}
class Child extends Person{
    constructor(name,age,city){
        super();
        this.city=city;
    }
}


syntax:
class App extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(
            //JSX
        )
    }
}
export default App;


2.Functional based components(FBC)
- similar to JS functions
-FBC is stateless becaues there is no state object until react v16.8

syntax:
function App(){
    return(

    )
}
export default App;
        or
